[Open Formatting Toggle in VSCode](vscode:extension/tombonnike.vscode-status-bar-format-toggle), [Formatting Toggle on VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tombonnike.vscode-status-bar-format-toggle)

[Formatting Toggle] is a single-utility extension if there ever was one. All it does is that it adds a nifty little control to your status bar:

Because most of the time, what you want is to have your code automatically formatted according to the style guide you are following (you *are* doing that, right?).

But sometimes, you are exploring a different repository (maybe a submodule with a different style guide) and suddenly everything is reformatted. This is where you do this:

Et voilÃ : you can safely navigate repositories you have not configured your formatter for ðŸ¤—.
