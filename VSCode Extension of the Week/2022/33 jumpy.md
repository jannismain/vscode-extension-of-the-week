This is an extension that provides fast cursor movements to arbitrary points in your code for us mere mortals, that have not reached enlightenment level with vim yet. You simply hit a keyboard shortcut you can configure yourself (for me it is `alt+return` for now) and 2-letter combinations will appear at every word (or line, if you prefer). You press the letters to move your cursor to that location.
